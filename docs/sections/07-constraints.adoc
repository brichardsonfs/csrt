=== 7. Apply Constraints

The CSRT is capable of constraining seed transfer based on available species distribution models (SDMs) and/or
ecoregions. If a SDM is available for the species of interest, we suggest using this constraint. The SDM constraint is
aligned with the climate scenario in Step 4 when available.
